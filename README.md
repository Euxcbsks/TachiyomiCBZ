# TachiyomiCBZ
Python script for converting Tachiyomi's traditional folder w/ images in it for each chapter to a single .cbz file for each chapter.

It is **HIGHLY** recommended to do a test-run (add the `-t` flag) before running the actual script as files will be deleted if the `-c` or `-d` flags are specified.

## Usage

`python3 main.py --help` for information on flags and parameters

0 verbosity is default but I recommend 2 levels of verbosity to see what is actually happening
